### Tim Belfield
## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a senior software engineer based in the West Midlands/North West. This is mainly my professional facing website, so this is mostly about my career facing profile. I like writing software for mobile experiences and have been doing so for a long time. I love modern **mobile-first** focussed apps that solve problems and save time for users with slick UI's and clever engineering solutions. I have worked on all types of great apps out there across the years, using different technology to solve key problems.
