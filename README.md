### Tim Belfield
## Hi there 👋

I'm a senior software engineer based in the West Midlands/North West. This is mainly my professional facing website, so this is mostly about my career facing profile. I'm a fan of writing software for mobile experiences and have been doing so for a long time. I love modern **mobile-first** focussed apps that solve problems and save time for users with slick UI's and clever engineering solutions. This has led me to work on all types of great apps out there across the years, using different technology to solve key problems.

### 🔭 I’m currently working on...
I like to use my spare time productively where possible. Right now I'm overloaded with a house renovation! Apart from painting, decorating and plastering, however I do try to do work every week on keeping my skills fresh. I keep up to date with the latest Swift and iOS changes as well as brushing up on areas that I feel I'm missing skills. As part of this i'm currently working on a tax app with an Accountant friend to help bring clarity to a somewhat confusing area of life.

  **Contractor** at Con Vit Software Ltd
  
  May 2024 - *Present*
  
  Remote - Leek, UK
  
  I run my own small consultancy typically for smaller clients who need app support but only for a few hours a month to keep their app up to date and running smoothly. Not every App needs an entire team of developers or new features every month. I specialise in keeping these apps humming along and providing support where other larger companies wouldn't care or wouldn't be interested.

 November 2022 - April 2024
 
 Remote - Leek, UK

 I worked at Poker Stars in a multi-team group focussed on sports betting features. Here we supported the various versions of the Poker Stars app by adding features that were often very complex due to regulations and the requirement of the App to support multiple markets in multiple languages.

I followed a Test Driven Development (TDD) approach using unit tests in XCTest and Snapshot tests using a third party tool. Team redundancy ended the role due to pivot of business priorities.
